# Financial Advisory using Generative AI

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to revolutionize financial advisory services using generative AI to provide personalized, data-driven financial advice to customers.

### Current Limitations
- **Generic Advice**: Traditional financial advisory services often provide generic, one-size-fits-all advice that may not suit individual financial situations.
- **Manual Data Analysis**: Financial advisors spend significant time manually analyzing customer data and market trends, which can lead to inefficiencies and errors.
- **Delayed Responses**: The inability to adapt quickly to market changes can result in missed opportunities and suboptimal financial advice.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Customers often lack trust in advisory services due to a lack of transparency in the decision-making process.

### Solution Goals
- **Personalized Advice**: Use generative AI to analyze customer financial data and market trends, generating tailored investment strategies.
- **Real-Time Advisory Services**: Provide real-time advisory services that adapt to changing financial conditions and customer goals.
- **Transparency and Explainability**: Ensure transparency and explainability in the AI-driven advisory process to build customer trust and confidence.
